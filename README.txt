Hey there!

This is the current code for my personal website.

These are essentially a new developer's resume, and as such mine's intended to represent what I'm currently capable of producing. Both the appearance of the page itself and the clarity, quality, and organization of the code in this repo should serve to illustrate the least of what I can do moving forward.
